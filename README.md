# FruitGrab: Know you fruit 

This is a simple app for knowing your fruit. The aim of this app is demonstate a pytorch based deep learing trained with FASTAI to deploy on the mobile. However few things are added to make it useful and more fun. 


## Made possible with ♥️
1. Pytorch convert model: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html
2. A good tutorial: https://drhb.github.io/blog/fastai/2020/03/22/Fastai-Jit.html
3. A a simple deployment app: https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/pytorch-mobile-image-classification-on-android-5c0cfb774c5b
